# ALC project: Physics-informed machine learning for accelerating inelastic neutron powder data analysis

This private repository is to store scripts and data related to the Ada-Lovelace-Centre project:
"Physics-informed machine learning for accelerating inelastic neutron powder data analysis"

ML train: srcnn, unet, fno three types of models. Limit means how many samples we will choose in ML method. 
SrCNN model example: 
python gen_robustness.py --model srcnn --limit 60
